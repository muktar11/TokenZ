/* If you want full interaction directly on your
 site, you'll need to implement Google OAuth2 
 for user authentication and make calls 
to the YouTube Data API, which is more complex
 and requires handling user permissions, token storage, and API 
 requests securely. This typically requires backend integration
  and careful handling of user data. */
